In this section, different snippets are provided to retrieve datasets or packages CKAN. Three different operations are detailed in order to retrieve the data. The first operation, [Datastore_search](retrieval/datastore-search.md), uses the DataStore API. The DataStore API offers the hability to search and filter data without the need to download the entire file first. The other two operations, [Reatrive a specific resource](retrieval/retrieve-specific-resource.md) and [Reatrive all resources from a group](retrieval/retrieve-from-ckangroup.md), use the general API provided by CKAN to interact with CKAN sites and their data.


Before you use the following snippets, please make sure, that you read the [terms of use](../about/licenses) of our data.
