In this section, different snippets are provided to create/store datasets or packages into CKAN. Four different operations are detailed using the DataStore API. The DataStore API offers the hability to insert a new data, or existing data can be updated or deleted. You can also add a new column to an existing table even if the DataStore resource already contains some data. 
These four operations are: [Datastore_create](storage/datastore-create.md), [Datastore_delete](storage/datastore-delete.md), [Datastore_upsert](storage/datastore-upsert.md) and [Package_create](storage/package-create.md).


Before you use the following snippets, please make sure, that you read the [terms of use](../about/licenses) of our data.
