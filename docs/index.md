# Welcome

Welcome to the Open City Toolkit Developer Corner! This website provides ample information about re-use of resources of the [Open City Toolkit (OCT)](http://giv-oct.uni-muenster.de/oct/) for software development purposes. It includes short installation guides for different development environments (e.g., node, bower, mkdocs), as well as different code snippets useful for data collection, storage, retrieval, analysis and visualization.
